In this section, we will apply various data cleaning techniques to the dataframe to remove any errors, inconsistencies, or irrelevant information that may impact your analysis. The goal of this section is to ensure that the data is in a clean, consistent, and usable format for analysis.\n",

    "- **Handling missing values**: Replacing or removing missing values from the dataframe.\n",
    "- **Removing duplicates**: Identifying and removing duplicate records from the dataframe.\n",
    "- **Fixing data types**: Converting data from one type to another, as needed, to ensure consistency across columns.\n",
    "- **Removing irrelevant information**: Removing any columns or records that are not needed for the analysis.\n",
    "- **Standardizing values**: Converting values to a standardized format, such as converting date strings to date objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "By documenting the data cleaning operations that were performed, you can ensure that the data is cleaned in a consistent and reproducible manner, and that your results can be easily validated by others.\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"Data Overview\" section has provided us with a comprehensive understanding of the state of the data. Upon review, it has been determined that the data is in good shape, with no missing values present. However, there are still a few cleaning operations that that we need to perform in order to ensure that the data is ready for analysis.\n",

    "We can divide the cleaning operation in two stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Standardization**: Involves standardization of specific fields for a better analysis\n",
    "- **Datatype Fixes**: Involves fixing any datatype errors or inconsistencies in the data, so that it can be effectively analyzed.\n",
    "\n",
    "By performing these cleaning operations, we will have a well-structured and usable data set that can be analyzed and used to gain insights and make informed decisions."

    "In this section, we will take a closer look at the data types of each column in the dataframe to ensure that they are correctly assigned. The goal of this step is to ensure that each column is stored in a format that accurately represents its data, allowing us to perform accurate calculations and analysis.\n",

    "During the \"Data Standardization\" steps, we have conditionally replaced values in the dataframe, so it is crucial to verify that the correct data types are in place. If needed, we will change the data type of a column to accurately reflect the data it contains.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we have a column that contains numbers, but it is stored as a string data type, we will change it to an integer or float data type. This will allow us to perform numerical calculations on the data and get meaningful results.\n",

This is a result of our previous standardization step where we converted the letter values into their integer equivalent. Additionally, the other fields in the dataframe have also been assigned appropriate data types.\n",

The process was broken down into several sections, including Data Overview, Dataframe Details, Field Details, Data Cleaning Operations, Datatype Fixes, Data Transformation, Field Renaming, Custom Index Addition, and Data Validation.\n",

    "Throughout the cleaning and transformation process, we discovered the data was in good shape with no null values present and with appropriate datatypes. However, we performed several operations to ensure the data was in the desired format.\n",

    "With the data now in a clean and usable format, the next steps would be to perform analysis and visualization on the dataset to gain actionable insights. Additionally, an interactive dashboard using Power BI could be built to present the insights to a wider audience."
